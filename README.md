# Recruiters Help project
Created Node.js project leveraging AWS managed services and Serverless
1. Cognito for user authentication
2. DynamoDB No SQL database
3. Lambda for the compute and to execute the code in the cloud.

This project would help all the recruiters to manage their recruitees. Currently this is a very hectic job for the Human resource managers to manage all the people who're applying for the jobs.
